description: Prevent running sudo commands in this NixOS configuration project

# No Sudo Commands Rule

**Never run sudo commands in this NixOS configuration project.**

This project uses:
- SOPS for secret management
- NixOS configuration files
- Home Manager configurations

Instead of sudo commands, use:
- `nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<host>` for system changes
- `home-manager switch --flake .#<host>` for user changes
- Direct file editing for configuration changes
- `sops` commands without sudo for secret management

If you need to check system state or files, suggest commands the user can run themselves rather than attempting to run them with elevated privileges.
